# Shared patterns

- Each component has a unique (amonst components of the same type) identifier `id`.
- Everything is defined in SI units, except when a base is explicitly mentioned in the description.
- The default sometimes only mentions the default element, not the default value (e.g. `true` and not `fill(fill(true, 3), 3)`)

# Data model

## Bus

The data model below allows us to include buses of arbitrary many terminals (i.e., more than the usual four). This would be useful for

- underground lines with multiple neutrals which are not joined at every bus;
- distribution lines that carry several conventional lines in parallel (see for example the quad circuits in NEVTestCase).

| name      | default   | type          | description                                   |
| --------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| terminals | [1,2,3,4] | Vector        |                                               |
| vm_max    | /         | Vector        | maximum conductor-to-ground voltage magnitude |
| vm_min    | /         | Vector        | minimum conductor-to-ground voltage magnitude |
| vm_cd_max | /         | Vector{Tuple} | e.g.  [(1,2,210)] means \|U1-U2\|>210         |
| vm_cd_min | /         | Vector{Tuple} | e.g.  [(1,2,230)] means \|U1-U2\|<230         |
| grounded  | []        | Vector        | a list of terminals which are grounded        |
| rg        | []        | Vector        | resistance of each defined grounding          |
| xg        | []        | Vector        | reactance of each defined grounding           |

The tricky part is how to encode bounds for these type of buses. The most general is defining a list of three-tupples. Take for example a typical bus in a three-phase, four-wire network, where `terminals=[a,b,c,n]`. Such a bus might have

- phase-to-neutral bounds `vm_pn_max=250`, `vm_pn_min=210`
- and phase-to-phase bounds `vm_pp_max=440`, `vm_pp_min=360`.

We can then define this equivalently as

- `vm_cd_max = [(a,n,250), (b,n,250), (c,n,250), (a,b,440), (b,c,440), (c,a,440)]`
- `vm_cd_min = [(a,n,210), (b,n,210), (c,n,210), (a,b,360), (b,c,360), (c,a,360)]`

Since this might be confusing for novice users, we also allow the user to define bounds through the following properties.

## Line

This is a pi-model branch. A linecode implies `rs`, `xs`, `b_fr`, `b_to`, `g_fr` and `g_to`; when these properties are additionally specified, they overwrite the one supplied through the linecode.

## Assymetric, Lossless, Two-Winding (AL2W) Transformer

These are transformers are assymetric (A), lossless (L) and two-winding (2W). Assymetric refers to the fact that the secondary is always has a `wye` configuration, whilst the primary can be `delta`.
